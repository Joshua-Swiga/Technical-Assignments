# RNA Sequencing and Machine Learning in Cancer Diagnosis

## Overview
This project uses RNA sequencing data combined with machine learning, specifically linear regression, to predict tumor malignancy. 
The model analyzes key tumor characteristics (e.g., radius_mean, perimeter_mean, and texture_mean) to assess their correlation with cancer diagnosis.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 569 tumor samples, with 357 classified as malignant and 212 as benign. Key features include:
- radius_mean
- perimeter_mean
- texture_mean

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
2. Run the Python script to perform the regression analysis and visualize the data.

## Results
The analysis highlights strong correlations between tumor characteristics and malignancy. The machine learning model provides reliable insights for early cancer detection.

## Code Availability
The code for this project can be found in the `linear_reg.ipynb` file.
